I am aware of the problems with Curseforge/WowAce atm. Twitch is kind of blocking access via the way I normally fetch updates. I've got a new solution in the works which will also allow you to hopefully search for addons inside the manager. This solution will take a few days to implement however, sorry for the inconvenience. You can still use the manager for WowInterface, Github, and Tukui however!
